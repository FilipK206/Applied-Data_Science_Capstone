## Executive Summary

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches, focusing on predicting the successful landing of the first stage. Through data collection from SpaceX's API and web scraping, followed by data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning prediction techniques, we aimed to create a machine learning pipeline for this prediction task. The project's goal is to determine the factors influencing successful landings and build models to predict landing outcomes.

## Introduction

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches with a significantly lower cost compared to other providers, largely due to the ability to reuse the first stage. Predicting the success of the first stage landing can help estimate launch costs, crucial for bidding against SpaceX. This project aims to identify factors influencing successful landings and establish a predictive model for first stage landing outcomes.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Utilized SpaceX API and web scraping from Wikipedia for data acquisition.
- **Data Wrangling**: Processed and enhanced data, including generating landing result classifications.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted visual and SQL-based analysis to understand data patterns and relationships.
- **Interactive Visual Analytics**: Employed Folium and Plotly Dash for interactive data visualization.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Built classification models to predict landing outcomes, with model evaluation and selection.

## Results

### Data Analysis Highlights:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Identified key features influencing successful landings.
  - Analyzed launch success trends over time.
- **Predictive Analysis**:
  - Achieved high accuracies for logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors models.
  - Confirmed the predictive capabilities of selected models through confusion matrix analysis.

## Conclusion

The analysis revealed several insights:
- Launch success correlates with factors such as launch site, payload mass, and orbit type.
- Notable success rates were observed for specific orbits and launch sites.
- Logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors are recommended models for landing prediction.
